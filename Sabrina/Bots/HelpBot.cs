                I'm sure many of you are aware of the Patreon debacle going on right now. I'm not about to get political on a hentai community Patreon page,
                but suffice it to say that I do not support censorship in any form, especially targeted censorship, and will be unpublishing this page on JANUARY 1st 2019.I truly want to thank everyone who has been a patron and supported me in ways I could never have imagined. Thank you so much<3
                That being said, let's make some points clear:

                - Patreon - exclusive content(videos and pictures) will continue to be released publicly, they will not vanish forever.
                -I do not have a Patreon replacement since just about every service does not allow adult /explicit content.
                -I plan to still create new, free, public content in the future.
                -I will return to Discord soon (currently lost my 2FA phone and can't login to Discord >.<).

                Thanks again everyone and I hope you have a wonderful New Year! <3",
